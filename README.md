# Lisa's FYP
A general overview of what I've done for my final year project at the National University of Singapore. Contents of the README aim to provide background on the project and its objective. This is not the thesis report. This project was carried out alone. 

## An Overview 
Small for gestational age (SGA) fetuses are described as those that fall within the 10th percentile of growth. While this is not necessarily a cause for concern, an SGA fetus caused by intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) may be concerning as it is likely that the fetus is not receiving the nutrients that it would need for healthy growth. This becomes dangerous when the fetus is unable to receive nutrients that are essential for survival such as oxygen, which might result un a stillbirth. Conversely, delivering the fetus too early in such circumstances might also result in improper development which might result in complications as the child grows. 

## The Project 
My project aimed to design a device that could non-invasively monitor fetal oxygen levels to help clinicians better decide when it might be appropriate to perform a C-Section to deliver the fetus.
